### What is the problem with Chinese README's

Firstly, we congratulate you for getting so much star by sharing this repository with humanity.

But it is very disappointing for non-Chinese speakers when one couldn't understand what a trending repository is about.

When we see such a repo on trending, our minds are blurring like Gollum's.

There is a way **you can help** to solve this disappointment which I believe is experienced by many people who want to know more about your valuable work and appreciate it.

### What we want:
 - Please add English translation of your README so you are sharing your work and knowledge with more people.

### How this will help you:
 - More feedback to fix and improve your project.
 - New ideas about your project.
 - Greater fame.
